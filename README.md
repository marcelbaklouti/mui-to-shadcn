A codemod that converts [Material UI](https://mui.com) (MUI) React code to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Pure AST transformation with [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com), no LLM. Targets shadcn CLI v4 and Tailwind CSS v4, and works with both the Radix and Base UI variants of shadcn.

## What it does

Several passes over your `.ts`/`.tsx` files, designed to leave as little manual work as possible — even on large codebases:

1. **Component mapping** — MUI components are restructured into their shadcn equivalents and imports are rewritten.
2. **Infrastructure removal** — `ThemeProvider`, `CssBaseline`, `StyledEngineProvider`, the MUI/Emotion cache providers and `GlobalStyles` are unwrapped or dropped (Tailwind's preflight replaces the baseline). `createTheme`/`styled`/`makeStyles` are flagged with a warning since they wrap arbitrary CSS.
3. **Event handlers** — when `onChange` becomes `onValueChange`/`onCheckedChange`, simple inline handlers are rewritten too: `(e) => setX(e.target.value)` becomes `(e) => setX(e)`, and MUI's `(event, value) => …` becomes `(value) => …`. Handlers that also use the event are left untouched with a warning.
4. **Icons** — `@mui/icons-material` imports and usages are converted to [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev) (what shadcn uses), e.g. `DeleteIcon` → `Trash2`. ~700 icon names are mapped; `fontSize`/`color` become classes. Unmapped icons are left in place with a note.
5. **`sx` / system props** — `sx={{ ... }}` and MUI shorthand props (`m`, `p`, `display`, `gap`, `width`, `color`, ...) become Tailwind classes. MUI spacing (8px) is converted to the Tailwind scale (4px), e.g. `p: 2` becomes `p-4`. `Box`/`Stack`/`Container` become `div`; `Grid` becomes a real CSS grid (`grid grid-cols-12` + `col-span-*`, including the v6/v7 `size`/`offset` props).

## Quick start

Run it without installing:

```bash
# dry run, prints the changes and the shadcn components it needs
npx mui-to-shadcn src --report

# write the changes
npx mui-to-shadcn src --write
```

Or as a one-command setup in your project (installs the shadcn components, then migrates):

```bash
npx mui-to-shadcn src --setup --base radix   # or --base base for Base UI
```

`--setup` will, in your project directory:

1. collect every shadcn component the migration needs,
2. run `shadcn init` (only if there is no `components.json`),
3. run `shadcn add <components>`,
4. write the converted files,
5. run `prettier --write`.

The package manager is detected from your lockfile (override with `--pm pnpm|npm|yarn|bun`). Use `--dry-run` to print the planned commands without running anything.

## CLI

```
mui-to-shadcn <path...> [options]

--write        write changes (default is a dry run)
--report       print every warning and manual item
--skip-sx      skip the sx / system-props pass
--setup        install shadcn components and run the full pipeline
--base <b>     radix (default) or base (Base UI)
--pm <m>       pnpm | npm | yarn | bun (otherwise auto-detected)
--dry-run      with --setup: print planned commands only
```

`<path>` can be a file or a directory (globbed as `**/*.{ts,tsx}`, excluding node_modules).

## Programmatic API

```ts
import { Project } from "ts-morph";
import { runMigration } from "mui-to-shadcn";

const project = new Project();
const file = project.addSourceFileAtPath("Component.tsx");
const result = runMigration(file, { base: "radix" });
console.log(result.text, result.warnings, result.manual, result.components);
```

## Component support

106 MUI components are catalogued. As of the current version: **89 fully converted**, **8 converted inside their parent**, **4 partial**, **5 left manual** with a note. The full, always-current table is generated from the registry:

- [docs/COMPONENTS.md](./docs/COMPONENTS.md) — full status table (regenerate with `npm run docs`)

Fully converted include Button, IconButton, Checkbox, Switch, RadioGroup, TextField, Select, the Form/Input primitives, Divider, LinearProgress, CircularProgress (lucide spinner), Skeleton, Paper, the Card family, Alert, Link, Typography, Avatar, Chip, Badge, Tooltip, Tabs (incl. the MUI Lab TabContext/TabList/TabPanel), Accordion, Dialog, Modal, Menu (DropdownMenu), Popover/Popper, Collapse (Collapsible), ToggleButtonGroup, Drawer/SwipeableDrawer (Sheet), Breadcrumbs, Pagination, the Table family, the List family, the Stepper family, Rating (lucide stars), the Transition components (unwrapped), Fab, AppBar/Toolbar, ImageList, and Box/Stack/Container.

Plus icons: `@mui/icons-material` → `lucide-react` (~700 names mapped).

Partial (best-effort, needs review): Grid / Grid2 / GridLegacy (real CSS grid; `size="grow"`/`"auto"` are flagged) and Slider.

Still manual on purpose (different paradigm or no shadcn equivalent, with a recipe in the report): DataGrid (TanStack Table + shadcn Table), Autocomplete (Combobox = Popover + Command), SpeedDial, Timeline, and BottomNavigationAction. These need React state/hooks the codemod can't safely synthesize, so it leaves your working code in place rather than emit a build-breaking stub.

## What the tool does not do

Even with `--setup`, some work needs human judgement:

- **Complex handlers**: simple inline `onChange` bodies are rewritten automatically, but a handler that also uses the event (e.g. `e.preventDefault()`) or a named function reference is left as-is with a warning — adjust it by hand.
- **Custom theming**: `createTheme`/`extendTheme` palettes, `styled()`, `makeStyles`, and `keyframes` wrap arbitrary CSS, so they are flagged (not converted). Port custom tokens to your Tailwind/shadcn theme, then remove the remaining `@mui/*` / `@emotion/*` dependencies (listed by `--setup`).
- **Base UI** (if selected): replace `asChild` with the render prop; `checked` is strictly boolean and `value` strictly an array; the Base UI `Select` also needs an `items` prop on the root and `nativeButton={false}` on non-button triggers.
- **Layout and visuals**: Grid maps to CSS grid best-effort and nested whitespace is not perfect, so review the result.

Radix or Base UI: the generated JSX uses the public shadcn API (`@/components/ui/*`, `onValueChange`, `type single/multiple`, `AccordionItem`), which is identical across both; only the underlying primitives differ.

## Compatibility

Targets shadcn CLI v4 (`shadcn init`/`add`, `--base radix|base`) and Tailwind CSS v4 (v4 shadow scale, container widths). Icons require [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev) (shadcn installs it). Output is valid TSX; run Prettier/ESLint afterwards (done automatically by `--setup`).
